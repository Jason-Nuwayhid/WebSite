                <p>
                    As many of you know, I have been completing a Master of
                    Divinity and a Master of Biblical Studies at Reformed
                    Theological Seminary (RTS). My journey to RTS was deeply
                    shaped by my late father, who attended seminary there before
                    he passed away from ALS. His professors cared for him
                    profoundly, even staying with him overnight in his final
                    weeks. Their love and faith in action inspired me to pursue
                    ministry and theological education. From my start at RTS, I
                    was inspired by my professors’ passion for God’s word. Their
                    example planted a seed in me to train and equip the next
                    generation of pastors. Some of my favorite professors were
                    also pastors who knew both the beauty and the challenges of
                    the church.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a family, we have been in ministry for about six years
                    serving the church. Seminary has deepened our love for the
                    church and our passion for seeing more churches experience a
                    bigger God and His mission to advance the Gospel. Two years
                    into seminary, my professors began to affirm my interest in
                    Old Testament Study, leading me to add a Master of Biblical
                    Studies. As I took advanced courses in the Hebrew Bible and
                    ancient languages, my desire to teach future pastors grew.
                    There is a great need for Old Testament scholars who uphold
                    the scriptures as the Word of God. To step into this
                    calling, I will need to obtain a PhD. I’m excited to share
                    that I have been accepted to the PhD program at the
                    University of Edinburgh!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This rare opportunity to study with world-renowned scholars
                    would equip me to train the next generation of pastors, who
                    will, in turn, shape the church at large. My vision is to
                    help pastors grow in their love for God’s Word, preach it
                    faithfully, and lead a gospel-centered church.

                    We can not take this journey alone. Moving to Scotland for
                    three years means leaving our jobs, and raising support for
                    tuition, visas, travel, and our family’s day-to-day needs –
                    an estimated $300,000. We know this is a “God Ask” but we
                    trust His provision. In His kindness, a donor has already
                    pledged to match what we raise, meaning if we raise 150,000
                    it will be matched dollar for dollar to meet our full need.
                    We would love for you to be a part of this journey to train
                    future pastors who are passionate about God’s word.

                    Our financial needs are complex for this venture. We need to
                    have 44% of the funds in our account before departing for
                    Scotland at the beginning of June. This means we have a
                    narrow timeline for raising funds, but a great opportunity
                    for your gifts to make a giant impact. There are options to
                    make monthly or even annual gifts as we live in Scotland,
                    but our greatest need for these four months of initially
                    raising funds is one-time special gifts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are looking for partners who will join this journey with
                    us in prayer and finances. Would you prayerfully consider
                    partnering with us?
